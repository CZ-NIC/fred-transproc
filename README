This is README file for transproc python script and other related scripts.
The purpose of this script is to connect to IMAP email account, download
email new messages and process them. Processing is done by dedicated scripts,
where each script handles one transcript format. It is possible to specify
mapping between the transcript processor and email attribute FROM. Based
on FROM header, the email is distributed to appropriate processor.

There is a configuration file for transproc, see example transproc.conf
in repository. The configuration file is searched in /etc/fred directory
by default. It is possible to specify its location on command line. It is
expected to be the first and only argument.
